# The application #
You will create an application that allows a librarian to manage his book catalog
as well as loans and returns. The application will:
- Display the list of books in the catalog and their status (available or loaned)
- View the list of all users registered in the system and their information
personal
- Add a book to the catalog
- To be able to sort the books according to their category thanks to a dropdown (for example: novel, poetry,
adventure...). When the user clicks for example on novel, the page displays only the books of the
category novel.
- To be able to access the descriptive card of each book recorded in BDD
- Be able to change the status of each book from available to loaned and loaned to available. When a
book is lent the librarian indicates the unique identification number of the user in order to
who borrowed what. When we come back to the description of the book it indicates
now the information from the book as well as from the user who borrowed it.
As a reminder, here is a non-exhaustive list of useful information to know about a book:
title, author, abstract, release date, category. Of course you will have to add others.
